# blueprint-B201-NINA-B1-EVA-M8
This blueprint is a small solar powered location device with the NINA-B1 Bluetooth Low Energy and the EVA-M8 GNSS modules from u-blox.

* Provides a reference for integration of u-blox BLE and GNSS modules for location applications.
* Implements a low power solution integrating a harvesting power system.
* Gives an example of components choice, placement, and layout.

A demo firmware is available that can be used to test features of the blueprint. The firmware collects location data and provides this data via the standardized Bluetooth Low Energy GATT Location and Navigation Service.
